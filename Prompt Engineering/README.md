# Overview

This repository details the prompt engineering efforts for developing an AI assistant to support culturally relevant K12 STEM education through inclusive, multicultural, and culturally responsive teaching practices.

## 1. Objective and Scope
**Objective**: Develop an AI assistant that aids educators in creating culturally relevant and engaging lesson plans.

**Scope**:
- Design and test initial prompts.
- Incorporate feedback for iterative improvements.
- Outline future plans for model enhancement.

## 2. Initial Prompt Engineering
- **Approach**: Use the Llama 3.1 model to generate culturally responsive lesson plans for Arts, Science, and Mathematics.
- **Key Elements**:
  - **System Prompt**: Focus on inclusivity, engagement, and cultural relevance.
  - **Testing**: Performed on the Ollama platform with iterative modifications to refine output.

## 3. Feedback and Enhancements
- **Feedback**:
  - Clarify and specify directives.
  - Improve handling of cultural nuances.
  - Enhance engagement in content creation.
- **Enhancements**:
  - Updated system prompts for better clarity and specificity.
  - Revised prompt structures for broader cultural relevance.
  - Conducted iterative testing for alignment with goals.

## 4. Evaluation and Identified Gaps
- **Metrics**:
  - Cultural relevance, scenario adaptability, and engagement.
- **Gaps**:
  - Need for finer cultural differentiation.
  - Balancing prompt specificity with flexibility.
  - Ensuring consistent alignment with learning objectives.

## 5. Future Plans
- **Continuous Feedback**: Share results for ongoing review.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Use gaps identified to create a dataset for further fine-tuning.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Conduct further tests and document results.
  2. Refine the script based on feedback.
  3. Explore additional fine-tuning to close gaps.
